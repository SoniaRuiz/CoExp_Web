                CoExp WebPage is a webpage tool developed in .NET Core Framework, for the easy use of <a href="https://github.com/juanbot/CoExpNets" target="_blank" title="CoExp R suite-of-packages available on GitHub">CoExp R suit-of-packages</a> (author: Juan A. Botía) - a framework for the generation, deployment,
                sharing and exploitation of co-expression networks as annotation models of genes and their role in transcription.
                <br /><br />
                In this case, we decided to build a web-based UI to manage the whole set of CoExp R suit-of-packages because it is undeniable that a web-page format is
                the most well-known and accepted way of browsing the Internet around the world. In this sense, we believe that a web-page structure will make CoExp's networks
                easily accessible to every potential user around the world, at any time and from anywhere they decide to do so. Thus, all CoExp R suit-of-packages' models
                are available and ready-to-use within CoExp WebPage application, and <b>can be accessed and used for your own research</b>.
                <br /><br />
                Finally, the main purpose of this page is to provide a detailed tutorial about how to effectively use the UI of CoExp Webpage. This tutorial has been divided in
                three main sections, which are detailed below.
            </p>

            <br /><h4><a asp-area="" asp-controller="Run" asp-action="Help_Introduction">INTRODUCTION</a></h4><br />
            <p>

            </p>

            <br /><h4><a asp-area="" asp-controller="Run" asp-action="Help_Catalog">CATALOG</a></h4><br />
            <p>
